## README!!
1. Add the lines below to you're qb-radialmenu/config.lua
```
{
  id = 'driftmode',
  title = 'Drift mode',
  icon = 'car-side',
  type = 'client',
  event = 'qbdriftmode:DriftMode',
  shouldClose = true
},
```

It should look something like:
```
                    }, {
                        id = 'extra12',
                        title = 'Extra 12',
                        icon = 'box-open',
                        type = 'client',
                        event = 'qb-radialmenu:client:setExtra',
                        shouldClose = false
                    }, {
                        id = 'extra13',
                        title = 'Extra 13',
                        icon = 'box-open',
                        type = 'client',
                        event = 'qb-radialmenu:client:setExtra',
                        shouldClose = false
                    }
                }
            }, {
                id = 'driftmodus',
                title = 'Drift modus',
                icon = 'car-side',
                type = 'client',
                event = 'qbdriftmode:DriftMode',
                shouldClose = true
            },
